  #We've learned bracket subsetting
  #It can be hard to read and prone to error
  #dplyr is great for data table manipulation!
  #tidyr helps you switch between data formats
  
  #Packages in R are collections of additional functions
  #tidyverse is an "umbrella package" that
  #includes several packages we'll use this quarter:
  #tidyr, dplyr, ggplot2, tibble, etc.
  
  #benefits of tidyverse
  #1. Predictable results (base R functionality can vary by data type) 
  #2. Good for new learners, because syntax is consistent. 
  #3. Avoids hidden arguments and default settings of base R functions
  
  #To load the package type:
  library(tidyverse)
